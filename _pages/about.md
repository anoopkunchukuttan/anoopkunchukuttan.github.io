I am a Principal Applied Researcher in the *Microsoft Machine Translation* team in Hyderabad, India. I am a founding member and co-lead of [AI4Bharat](https://ai4bharat.iitm.ac.in), a research center based in IIT Madras that works to drive advances and build resources for Indian language NLP. I am honored to be currently serving as an area chair for ACL Rolling Review (ARR) in the multilinguality and low-resource/efficient NLP areas. I have also served as an adjunct faculty in the Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras in the past.

My research areas are Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Information Extraction, and Retrieval.  

My research interests include multilingual learning and LLMs, post-training of LLMs, reasoning and evaluation in LLMs, representation learning, NLP for related languages, machine translation, and transliteration. I am interested in building tools and resources for Indian language NLP.  

Over the last decade, I have built/contributed to large-scale, broad-coverage resources like the Indic NLP Library, IndicTrans/Sata-Anuvaadak Translation systems, IndicLLMSuite, Airavata LLM, IIT Bombay Parallel Corpus, Samanantar Corpus, Indic NLP/NLG Suite, and Aksharantar/BrahmiNet transliteration corpora.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2018 at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in), [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in). I did my research under the guidance of [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb) at the [Center for Indian Language Technology](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in). My doctoral research work explored various facets of machine translation and transliteration between related languages.
